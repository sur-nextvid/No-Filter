# Avoiding Common Attacks

Measures that were taken to ensure that the contracts are not susceptible to common attacks.

- **OpenZeppelin library for smart contract imports:** using OpenZeppelin smart contracts library I'm using verified and audited code that's already working on the main net without issues.
- **Ownable contract:** for smart contract management and transfer ownership functionality.
- **Destructible contract:** in order to be able to kill the contract.
- **Security Audit** utilized the services of https://securify.ch/ security scanner to check for unseen vulnerabilities
- Consensys security best practices.
- Smart contract code commented using best practices.
